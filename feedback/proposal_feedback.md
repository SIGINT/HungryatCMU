15437 Project Proposal Feedback

#### Feedback from Charlie Garrod

"Overall your project idea is good, and will provide an excellent opportunity for you to sucessfully demonstrate the fundamental web application engineering ideas of the course.

How do you plan to populate the restaurant data for your project?  In your proposal you explicity describe two types of users -- customers and restaurant employees -- but your site should also include a notion of administrative users that provides some control over the data and/or restaurant accounts affiliated with the site.

I strongly agree with your plan to defer features related to the financial transactions; these features would merely be a distraction from your overall project.

Are you familiar with the Wheel Deliver website?  They include features very similar to the site you are proposing.  I recommend that you see their site for inspiration for your own site's design.  (My memory is that their site could easily be improved upon.)

Looking forward to the next phases of your project,

#### Proposal Feedback from Ramapulla Reddy Chennuru (rchennur@andrew.cmu.edu)

Good job in coming up with decent idea for the proposal. Application scope is apt for a final project. I believe you can use Django role based authentication modules to separate the actions based on the roles. You can have a simple stub to substitute for a payment system and complete the transactions. Will there be an admin role who can authorize adding a restaurant or just any user can register himself as a owner and start creating restaurants and menus? From technical stand point, I do not see any problems with this project.

#### Feedback from Sairam Krishnan (sbkrishn@andrew.cmu.edu)

Your project sounds very practical. At this point, before starting to program anything, you should decide upon the core features that must be in your app. The only danger that I can see from this high-level description is that since there's so much room for your app to evolve, you might try to do too much.
